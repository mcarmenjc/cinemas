Lovably mischievous crooning critters Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) are still causing chaos for their long-suffering human companion, Dave (Jason Lee). But now he&#x27;s got a new girlfriend: a lovely doctor named Samantha (Kimberley Williams-Paisley). Alas, her teenage son Miles (Josh Green) takes an instant dislike to our furry heroes. Fearing that Dave will propose to Samantha during a trip to Miami, which would make them all brothers, Miles and the chipmunks team up for a crazy cross-country road trip to prevent this happening. Following a hilarious incident aboard a plane, they find themselves hotly pursued by a furious Air Marshal (Tony Hale). Watch out for some great cameos in this latest outing for everybody&#x27;s favourite squeaky, misbehaving chipmunks. They also do a splendid chimpmunked version of Uptown Funk down in New Orleans.<br><br>Advisory Information<br>This film contains a sequence of flashing lights which might affect customers who are

Lovably mischievous crooning critters Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) are still causing chaos for their long-suffering human companion, Dave (Jason Lee). But now he's got a new girlfriend: a lovely doctor named Samantha (Kimberley Williams-Paisley). Alas, her teenage son Miles (Josh Green) takes an instant dislike to our furry heroes. Fearing that Dave will propose to Samantha during a trip to Miami, which would make them all brothers, Miles and the chipmunks team up for a crazy cross-country road trip to prevent this happening. Following a hilarious incident aboard a plane, they find themselves hotly pursued by a furious Air Marshal (Tony Hale). Watch out for some great cameos in this latest outing for everybody's favourite squeaky, misbehaving chipmunks. They also do a splendid chimpmunked version of Uptown Funk down in New Orleans.<br><br>Advisory Information<br>This film contains a sequence of flashing lights which might affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy.</p>

Baffled Interpol Fashion Division agent Valentina (Penelope Cruz) recruits our heroes to go undercover in the world of high fashion, which is now dominated by plastic surgery enthusiast Alexanya Atoz (Kristen Wiig). Delighted to find themselves back in the game, Derek and Hansel soon find that all roads lead to their old foe, Mugatu (Will Ferrell). Ben Stiller's long-awaited sequel to his much-loved fashion industry satire includes a host of great star cameos, from Benedict Cumberbatch to Justin Bieber.</p>

Fur trapper Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is leading a hunting party in 1820s South Dakota when he&#x27;s attacked and viciously mauled by a bear. Rather than tending to his wounds, the frontiersman&#x27;s traitorous companions, led by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), decide to abandon him. They kill his half-Native American son and leave Glass to perish in a shallow grave. But he survives. Now he must brave warring tribes, a savage environment and a ferociously harsh winter on a 120-mile trek to take his revenge.

Fur trapper Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is leading a hunting party in 1820s South Dakota when he's attacked and viciously mauled by a bear. Rather than tending to his wounds, the frontiersman's traitorous companions, led by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), decide to abandon him. They kill his half-Native American son and leave Glass to perish in a shallow grave. But he survives. Now he must brave warring tribes, a savage environment and a ferociously harsh winter on a 120-mile trek to take his revenge. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's raw and gritty follow-up to the Oscar-winning Birdman is based on an extraordinary true story of betrayal, survival and ultimate redemption. Its incredible authenticity stems from Inarritu's determination to film Glass's gruelling ordeal using natural light in genuinely unforgiving locations. The superb supporting cast includes Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson.</p>

In 1957, America is in the grip of Cold War paranoia when a hulking great robot (Vin Diesel) crashlands in the woods near the home of nine-year-old sci-fi enthusiast Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal). Boy and metal-munching alien giant soon start to bond. But when sinister agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) starts sniffing around, Hogarth recruits beatnik artist Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr) to conceal his clanking friend.

In 1957, America is in the grip of Cold War paranoia when a hulking great robot (Vin Diesel) crashlands in the woods near the home of nine-year-old sci-fi enthusiast Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal). Boy and metal-munching alien giant soon start to bond. But when sinister agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) starts sniffing around, Hogarth recruits beatnik artist Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr) to conceal his clanking friend. Witty, sophisticated and determinedly retro, The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol director Brad Bird's multiple award-winning feature debut from 1999 is adapted from Ted Hughes' much-loved 1968 children's novel. It's brilliantly animated, melding the 3D computer-modelled giant seamlessly with traditional 2D characters and backgrounds. This Signature Edition has been lovingly remastered and is enhanced with two brand new additional scenes by animators who worked on the original film.</p>

Macho tough guy Sebastian (Mark Strong) is MI6&#x27;s most deadly assassin. He also has a big brother named Nobby (Sacha Baron Cohen). They were adopted separately as children and couldn&#x27;t be more different. Nobby is a dim-witted football hooligan who lives in the northern fishing port of Grimsby with his nine children and girlfriend (Rebel Wilson). But he&#x27;s always yearned to be reunited with his sibling. Now, after 28 years apart, he learns of Sebastian&#x27;s whereabouts.

It&#x27;s Regency England, but not as we know it. In this alternate universe, the Black Plague has caused the dead to rise from their graves. So finding a suitable husband is hardly uppermost in the minds of Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and her feisty sisters. Instead, they&#x27;ve been trained in armed combat since childhood to take on the ravening zombie hordes.

It's Regency England, but not as we know it. In this alternate universe, the Black Plague has caused the dead to rise from their graves. So finding a suitable husband is hardly uppermost in the minds of Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and her feisty sisters. Instead, they've been trained in armed combat since childhood to take on the ravening zombie hordes. Now Elizabeth joins forces with hunky Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) on the battlefield, where they find love while dispatching the undead. Adapted from Seth Grahame-Smith's bestselling parody of Jane Austen's much-loved novel, this thrill-packed action-horror supercharges Austen's exploration of manners and morality with lashings of martial arts zombie-slaying mayhem! The superb cast includes Game of Thrones stars Charles Dance and Lena Headey, alongside Lily James's real-life beau, Matt Smith, who plays Mr. Collins.</p>

                    <p><strong>Synopsis: </strong> An imaginative Hindi reworking of Dickens' Great Expectations set in the Kashmir valley. Noor is an impressionable shikara boy living by the piers of Kashmir's Dal Lake, who finds himself drawn in to the world of the wealthy Begum (Tabu). He falls for her beautiful daughter Firdaus, who has a reputation for breaking young men's hearts, even though she comes from a very different social world. As an adult, Noor (Aditya Roy Kapoor) relocates to Delhi to pursue a career as an artist. He also continues to strive for acceptance in the sophisticated circles in which Firdaus (Katrina Kaif) moves, in the hope of winning her love. But the Begum, who is nursing a broken heart of her own, is bent on destroying any chance they have of happiness together. Working with an attractive young cast, Abhishek Kapoor skilfully transposes the Charles Dickens classic Great Expectations to India. His stunning locations include the beautiful Nishat Bagh.</p>

Bickering buddies Ben Barber (Kevin Hart) and James Payton (Ice Cube) are back! Annoying Ben is now a fully-fledged Atlanta cop who&#x27;s engaged to long-suffering, tough-as-old-boots detective James&#x27;s lovely sister, Angela (Tika Sumpter). But just as this happy couple are preparing for their wedding, the unlikely cop partners are given a new assignment.

It&#x27;s February 1952. Off the coast of New England, one of the worst storms on record is wreaking havoc - and one oil tanker is caught right in the middle of it. With the vessel fatally damaged and ripped in half by the force of the sea, prospects look bleak for the 30 sailors left stranded on-board. However, they reckoned without the brave intervention of four Coast Guard members who, against all the odds, begin a daring rescue mission to bring the men home. Loosely based on the remarkable Pendleton rescue mission, widely considered to be the greatest small boat rescue in Coast Guard history, this dramatic and thrilling endurance adventure is led by Star Trek&#x27;s Chris Pine. Also in the cast are Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Casey Affleck and Britain&#x27;s Holliday Grainger.","issub":false,"ism4j":false,"reldf":"19/02/2016","is2d":true,"cats":["drama","thriller"],"isSS":false,"reld":1455840000000,"BD":[{"d":1455840000000,"P":[{"dt":1455883200000,"sub":0,"ri":1,"vt":201,"n":"The

Off the coast of New England, one of the worst storms on record is wreaking havoc - and one oil tanker is caught right in the middle of it. With the vessel fatally damaged and ripped in half by the force of the sea, prospects look bleak for the 30 sailors left stranded on-board. However, they reckoned without the brave intervention of four Coast Guard members who, against all the odds, begin a daring rescue mission to bring the men home. Loosely based on the remarkable Pendleton rescue mission, widely considered to be the greatest small boat rescue in Coast Guard history, this dramatic and thrilling endurance adventure is led by Star Trek's Chris Pine. Also in the cast are Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Casey Affleck and Britain's Holliday Grainger.</p>

On September 5, 1986, Pan Am flight 73 is hijacked by terrorists while on the ground at Jinah International Airport in Karachi. As the senior cabin crew member, 22-year-old flight attendant Neerja Bhanot (Sonam Kapoor) takes charge. The terrorists instruct her to collect the passengers' passports so that they can identify the Americans on board, but she hides them instead. After a tense 17-hour stand-off, Neerja bravely opens an emergency door, permitting many of the passengers to escape unharmed. This gripping biopic of the youngest-ever recipient of Ashoka Chakra award - India's highest peacetime military decoration for gallantry - is the second feature from award-winning commercials director Ram Madhvani. It showcases a very different side of multi-talented Prem Ratan Dhan Payo star Sonam Kapoor, who has spoken of her commitment to celebrating this unsung national hero.</p>
